# Paleomagnetic_Data_from_Chinese_Literature
This database is a compilation of paleomagnetic data from Chinese literature.

## Why Do It
When I was an MSc student, I found many paleomagnetic data were published in
only Chinese. Why not share them with a "Hello, World!".

## Initial Idea
This small database will include two versions. One contains data from the
literature published only in Chinese. The other one contains all the data
published in English or Chinese for those tectonic plates/blocks/terranes of
East Asia, mainly China area, for example, North China, South China, Tarim, etc.
